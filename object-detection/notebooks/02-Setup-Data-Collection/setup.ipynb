    "\n",
    "And how do we actually obtain these bounding boxes? In real-life applications, you would need to label a dataset of images by hand. But if you have access to a simulator that is able to segment images, you could obtain the bounding boxes directly from the segmented images. \n",

The script we will use for this is the [data_collection.py](../../packages/utils/data_collection.py) file. You can edit the file in order to change the some parameters on what to generate, e.g. the number of images generated, which maps to be used by the simulator. More parameters (with description) can be found in the file, under the comment line:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](../../assets/images/setup_instr_data_col_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the [data_collection.py](../../packages/utils/data_collection.py) script is to automatically generate data for you from the simulator. \n",
    "In the rest of this activity we will walk step by step through the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, your dataset's format depends heavily on your model. If you want to use the [YoloV5](https://github.com/duckietown/yolov5) model that we suggest, you should closely follow their [guide on how to train using custom data](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data). Your data should follow the following directory structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image of dataset save format](../../assets/images/dataset_format.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is called `duckietown_object_detection_dataset` and is stored inside the `assets/` directory of this learning experience.\n",
    "We have created two subdirectories in that folder: `train` and `val`. Both these directories should contain two subdirectories, `images` and `labels`. Inside `images`, you must place your images, and inside `labels`, you must place the images' bounding boxes data. Notice that the label files use the same name as their corresponding image files but with a different extension. In other words, the data for `0.jpg` can be found in `0.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format for the label files is fairly simple. For each bounding box in the corresponding image, write a row of the form `class x_center y_center width height`. Keep in mind that the pixel data must be 0-to-1 normalized (i.e., you can calculate the usual `x_center y_center width height` in pixel space and divide by the image's size). For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "    0 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.2\n",
    "    1 0.60 0.70 0.4 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "this says \"there is a duckie (class 0) centered in the image, whose width and height are 20% of the image's. There is also a cone (class 1) whose center is at 60% of the image's maximal x value and 70% of the image's maximal y value, and its width is 40% of the image's own while its height is 20%.\"\n",
