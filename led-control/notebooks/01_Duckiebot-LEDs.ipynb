The *led_emitter* takes an `LEDPattern` and constructs a set of *RGBA* values for the LEDs to match the pattern.  It then sends those values to the *led_driver* to update the state of each individual LED.  We will cover both of these nodes in more depth in the next notebook.\n",

    "The ROS `header` passes along some standard metadata with the message, including the timestamp at which it was sent and a unique message ID number that increases consecutively with every message published.  You can find more details on the ROS documentation for the [std_msgs/Header message](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Header.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "The color of each individual LED is defined using the `R, G, B` components of the `std_msgs/ColorRGBA[] rgb_vals` in the `LEDPattern` message.  Each color component is a `float32` value from 0.0-1.0 that is mapped to the 0-255 color range.  For example, a red LED would be represented as `{r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0}`  The *led_driver* node is given only this portion of the `LEDPattern` message.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining an LED pattern rather than commanding individual LEDs, we can use `color_list` to define the LED colors as a list of strings such as `['green','yellow','pink','orange','blue']`.  When given a full pattern, the *led_emitter* node translates this to the required `rgb_vals` for the *led_driver*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are we setting the frequency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each LED blinks at a frequency defined by the `float32 frequency` in the `LEDPattern` message.  The frequency can be applied to individual LEDs using the frequency mask, which updates only the LED indices set to one. For example, the mask `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]` would cause only the front left and front right LEDs to blink at the given frequency.\n",
