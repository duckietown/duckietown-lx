The drone is equipped with a [VL53L0X distance sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-vl53l0x-micro-lidar-distance-sensor-breakout), which is used for estimating the distance from the drone to the ground. The sensor outputs a digital signal which is read in by the Raspberry Pi via I2C communication using the associated [Python library](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/vl53l0x/en/latest/).\n",
