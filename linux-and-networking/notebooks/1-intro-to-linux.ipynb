    "# Introduction to Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning objectives of this assignment are to familiarize you with\n",
    "basic Linux shell commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- standard input (`stdin`)\n",
    "- standard output (`stdout`)\n",
    "- standard error (`stderr`)\n",
    "- pipes (`|`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use these ideas when interacting with the Linux shell to operate your Duckiebot or Duckiedrone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally you will use these ideas in the next notebook when working on the networking exercises.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Terminal basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Working over the terminal is a skill that every roboticist-to-be needs to acquire. It enables you to work on remote\n",
    "agents or computers without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI) and lets you work very efficiently. Once you get the hang of it, you will find out for yourself how it can make your life easier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are completely new to working with a terminal, often also called \"console\" or \"command line\", a beginners tutorial can be found [here](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners#0). It makes sense to get to know the terminal very well, as this will save you a lot of time along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "When you enter a command in a shell, it executes a program. These programs read\n",
    "from a stream, known as \"standard input\" and write to two output streams,\n",
    "\"standard output\" and \"standard error\". When you `print` in Python, the program you execute writes\n",
    "its output to standard output. In another language, such as C, you use other\n",
    "functions, such as `printf` to write to standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to writing to standard output, a program can read from standard\n",
    "input. The program `cat`, short for concatenate, reads from standard input\n",
    "and writes the result to standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Output\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python program named `hello1.py` that prints \"Hello world\" to standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a Python program named `hello2.py` that prints `Hello world` to standard output using\n",
    "   `sys.stdout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a *bash script* named `hello.sh` that prints \"Hello World\" to standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Write these answers to questions 1-2 in`shell.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run `cat` with no arguments. Why does `cat` seem like it is hanging?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When you run `cat`, type a message into your terminal, and press\n",
    "   `Control-D`. Describe what `cat` does. Make sure to include which streams\n",
    "   are being used, and for what purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a Python program `my_cat.py` that reads a message from\n",
    "   standard input and prints to standard output, just as `cat` does.\n",
    "   You only need to reproduce the behavior of `cat` when run with no\n",
    "   arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipes\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipes are used to redirect standard input, standard output, and standard error.\n",
    "First, `>` is used to redirect standard output to a file. For example, `echo \"Hello World\" > test.txt` will write the string `Hello World` to `test.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write answers to questions 1-4 in `shell.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create files `one.txt`, `two.txt` and `three.txt` that contain the strings\n",
    "   `1`, `2`, and `3`, respectively using `echo` and output redirect. \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. By convention, almost all shell programs read input from standard input, and\n",
    "   write their output to standard output. Any error messages are printed to\n",
    "   standard error. You can chain shell programs together by using `|`. For\n",
    "   example, the program `ls` writes the contents of a directory to standard\n",
    "   output. The program `sort` reads from standard input, sorts what\n",
    "   it reads, and writes the sorted content to standard output. So you can use\n",
    "   `ls | sort` to print out a sorted directory list. Read the man page for sort\n",
    "   (`man sort`) to learn how to sort in reverse order. What is the bash script (using `|`) that prints the contents of a directory in reverse alphabetical order? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `cat`, `|` and `echo` to print `hello world.` Do not write to any files\n",
    "   and use both commands one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This is not the simplest way to print `hello world`. Can you suggest\n",
    "   a simpler way? (We asked you to do it the more complicated way to practice\n",
    "   with pipes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a Python script that reads from standard input, sorts lines in reverse\n",
    "   alphabetical order, and prints the result. It should behave like `sort -r`.  It does not need to process any command line arguments.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Submit your script in a file called `my_reverse_sort.py`. Do not submit this script in `shell.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Error\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to standard input and standard output, there is a third stream,\n",
    "standard error. If there is an error in a chain of pipes, it will be printed to\n",
    "the terminal rather than buried in the input to the next program.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recall that `ls -a | sort > sorted.txt` puts all the names of files in\n",
    "   a directory sorted in alphabetical order into the file `sorted.txt`. If you\n",
    "   modify the command to be `ls -a -hippo | sort > sorted.txt`, what text is in\n",
    "   `sorted.txt`, what is output as standard error, and why? \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Answer this question in `shell.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a python script that prints reversed sorted output to standard error. Use it to sort `ls -a` instead\n",
    "   of `sort`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Submit the file containing the script as `my_sort_status.py`.\n"
