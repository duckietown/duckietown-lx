    "#### Network utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will discuss some useful tools that can help understand the network on which you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is nothing simpler than finding your hostname: simply type `hostname` in a terminal. Now, make sure you are connected to a network first. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `ifconfig` command to find some properties of this network. Open a terminal and type the command `ifconfig`. You might be missing the package that provides this command. If that is the case, install it and try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**note:** on Windows the `ifconfig` command is replaced by `ipconfig`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ifconfig` command outputs a few paragraphs, one for each network interface. You typically will find one called something like `wlan0` (your wireless interface) and another one called `eth0` (your Ethernet interface). Look at the one through which you are connected at the moment. After the keyword `inet` you should see your IP address and after the keyword `ether` or `HWadress` you should get the MAC address of this interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you determine what is your sub-network? How many devices can you put on this sub-network?\n",
    "\n",
    "<end/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know what your network is, it is time to explore the devices on it. There are many ways to do this. If you know about a device that should be connected, like your Duckiebot or Duckiedrone, then you can directly try to find it. To do so, you can try to ping it. This will just \"poke\" the device to see if it is on the network and it is responsive to the poking. You can ping by IP address and a hostname. Pinging by IP address always works if a device is connected to the network. Pinging by hostname requries that mDNS is enabled, therefore if that fails it could mean that either your device is not connected, or that the mDNS traffic is being blocked on your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ping\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run `ping ![hostname]`, where `hostname` is your Duckiebot or Duckiedrone’s hostname.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it work? What is the output? Now try `ping ![hostname].local` instead. Does this work? For the router to find a device with its hostname, it needs to know that the hostname is in the local network, not somewhere else on internet. In contrast, try to ping a server outside of the local network: `ping google.com`. You can stop pinging the Duckiebot/Duckiedrone by pressing `CTRL-C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you pinged your robot, did you notice that there was an IP address in the output? Is it yours? No! It is the IP of the robot! You can now use this IP address and try pinging with it. Do you need to add the `.local` this time? Can you figure out why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This part will be very important for a lot of the things you will do in Duckietown. When you have troubles connecting to your robot, the first thing to try is to ping it and make sure it is still accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NMap\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now investigate what is on our network by using one of the many network mapping tools that exist out there. Keep in mind that depending on the network and the devices on it, you might not be able to see every device and every parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you know your IP address, you also know your sub-network. Using the tool `nmap` , we are going to search the whole sub-network. Try to run `nmap -sP ![YOUR IP]/24` in a terminal. The `/24` part tells `nmap` to keep the 24 first bits the same in its search. If you don’t put it, then nmap will search the complete space of address (which are the monstrous 2^32 addresses).\n",
    "\n",
    "The output should give you the list of all devices connected to your network, with their IP addresses and most of the time their hostnames. This way, you found your hostname and its IP, as well as other potentially present Duckiebots or computers.\n"

    "## Netcat\n",
    "\n",
    "The command `nc` is short for \"netcat\" and is similar to `cat` but works over\n",
    "network connections. It reads from standard input and writes its contents not\n",
    "to standard output, but to a specified server. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answers in the corresponding sections of `networking.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Point `nc` to google.com as follows: `nc www.google.com 80` When you first\n",
    "   connect, it will be silent. Then type any arbitrary text and press enter.\n",
    "   What is the error number?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now type a valid http request into nc and press enter: `GET / HTTP/1.1`. What is the output?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now use `nc` to make a server. In one window, type `nc -l 12345`. This\n",
    "   will cause `nc` to listen on port `12345`. In *another terminal* on the same\n",
    "   machine, type `nc localhost 12345`. You can type a message in one window\n",
    "   and it will appear in the other window (and vice versa). This trick can be\n",
    "   very useful to test basic internet connectivity - if the client and server\n",
    "   can send packets at all. *No answer* is required for this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. By convention, `roscore` listens on port `11311`. Try using `nc` to connect to\n",
    "   port `11311` on a machine where `roscore` is running, such as the your Duckiebot or Duckiedrone.\n",

    "## Talking to Your Robot\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, this assignment has required access to `localhost`, the local machine\n",
    "you are connected to, and `google.com`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly, the base station and robot are connected over TCP/IP to the same\n",
    "local network. Then you can look up your machine's IP address (`ifconfig` in\n",
    "Unix; other ways in other OSes), and your robot's IP address, and connect them.\n",
    "How can you find your robot's IP address? Well it's a chicken-and-egg problem.\n",
    "If you knew the IP address, you can connect to the robot and run `ifconfig` and\n",
    "find the IP address, but you don't know the IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do? There are several solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write the answers to the following questions in `networking.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Brainstorm how you can solve the chicken-and-egg program to connect to your robot. List three different solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Look Ma, No Internet!\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about if there *is* no public internet connection? What if you want to use your robot in the wilderness? Well, there does exist cellular modems and\n",
    "satellite connections, but you can also tell your robot to act as a Wifi\n",
    "Hotspot. It can create a network and run a DHCP server. Then you can connect\n",
    "your laptop's base station using the SSID and passphrase specified in that\n",
    "file, and connect to the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can set up your laptop as the Wifi base station and configure\n",
    "the robot to connect to its network. The details will vary depending on your\n",
    "laptop OS and settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Duckiedrone you can configure it to be a Wireless AP Master by default [(see here)](https://staging-docs.duckietown.com/daffy/opmanual-duckiedrone/drone-handling/first-connection.html). Connect to it with your base station. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write the answers to the following questions in `networking.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which machine is acting as the DHCP server?\n",
    "2. What is the Duckiedrone's IP address? What is yours?\n",
    "3. Describe another network configuration for the wifi, other than the robot being a Wireless AP Master.  \n",
    "4. Describe three network configurations for a network allowing a basestation and robot to communicate with each other. Feel free to add additional devices, such as a cell phone performing internet connection sharing. \n"
