    "The particle filter allows us to estimate the robot's state by tracking some set of likely states and updating these as we get new measurements. This is achieved using a set of particles, where each particle $i$ represents a hypothesis of the state state $x_t^i$ with its associated weight $w_t^i$. So for example, in the context of state estimation (e.g., localization), each particle represents how likely the robot is to be located at that particular state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is as follows. First, we initialize the particle filter by sampling $M$ particles. Usually the initial set of particles can be sampled uniformly from the set of all possible states (i.e., uniform sampling). Given a control signal $u_t$, we move all the particles (i.e., the state associated with each particle) that we currently have following the motion model. After this, we take a measurement $z_t$ (which we can get from our sensor) and update the weights of each particle based on how likely we are to measure $z_t$ if we were at the corresponding state of each particle (e.g., $p(z_t | x_i)$). We then resample all the particles, not uniformly, but according to the weights of each particle (i.e., the ones with higher weights are more likely to be sampled). This means that the particles that have higher weights will be sampled more often, while the ones with low weights may not be sampled at all. There are different options to obtain the predicted (i.e., filtered) state. In this notebook, we will do the simplest approach by taking the mean of the resampled particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then repeat this process every time we have new $u_t$ and $z_t$. In practice, we may not know what $p(z_t|x_i)$ is, so we may need other ways to compute the particle weight. We will see this later in the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above algorithm is the basic algorithm for the particle filter. There are some associated challenges and different algorithm variations try to address these issues. For example, if we implement the above algorithm, the performance will be largely affected by the initial set of particles because during resampling step, we only sample particles from the set of initial particles. Thus, it is possible that we may not even have particles that are near the correct state. This problem is sometimes known as particle depletion. To help alleviate this problem, during resampling step, instead of sampling completely from the set of particles that we currently have according to their weights, we can sample a small percentage of particles randomly from the set of all possible particles. \n",

    "## Example: estimating robot position with particle filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a robot moving in a room without obstacles. The robot is equipped with two sensors to measure distance between the robot and the walls, which allows the robot to measure the location of the robot (i.e., $x$ and $y$ positions) in the room. For the sake of simplicity, assume that the sensors directly provide us with a noisy measurement of the $(x,y)$ location in the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say the state of the robot is its $x$ and $y$ position in the room, and the control inputs are the velocity in each direction $v_x$ and $v_y$. The robot is initialized at $(x,y) = (0,0)$, and moves by applying constant control inputs $v_x = v_y = 0.1$ for 100 time steps. At each time step, after applying a control signal, the robot can take a measurement using the sensors to have an idea where it currently is. \n",

Note that, unlike the Kalman filter, there is no requirement that the model be linear or have noise that is either additive or Gaussian. We are defining things this way to keep things simple. \n",
