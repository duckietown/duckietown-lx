    "1. The basic case is that of a differential drive robot, which can turn in place. \n",
    "2. The advanced case is a car-like dynamics: the robot cannot turn in place, because there is a bound on the maximum path curvature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **environment complexity** we have 3 cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The basic case is that of an **empty** environment.\n",
    "2. The intermediate case is that of an environment with **static** obstacles.\n",
    "3. The advanced case is that of an environment with **dynamic** obstacles (with known motion).\n",

    "## Tips for implementing the planners\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start with the empty obstacles challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the challenges with the empty environment. You should be able to compute a plan that moves from pose A to pose B.\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way to do it is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting at pose A, turn towards pose B.\n",
    "2. Go forward until you reach B in x,y coordinates.\n",
    "3. Adjust the orientation to B's orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple algorithm will work, but it produces path with infinite curvature, as you turn in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to implement a function of this signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def connect_poses(ps: PlanningSetup, a: FriendlyPose, b: FriendlyPose) -> List[PlanStep]:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Also note that, without loss of generality, you can assume that `a` is the identity, by translating `b` in the frame of `a`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continue with the static obstacles case\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the static obstacles case, you can apply a graph-search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should create a cube of states: the generic node has coordinates (x,y,theta). The coordinates  x, y are distributed in a grid in the `bounds` given by the `PlanningSetup` message. The thetas are distributed in [0, 360], but note that 0 and 360 are the same point! You likely want to have `thetas = [0, 10, 20, ..., 340, 350]`, and make sure that 0 and 350 are neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolution that you need depends on the `tolerance` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For creating the graph it is convenient to use the `networkx` library (as in the previous notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should connect two nodes with an edge if `connect_poses` can find a plan to connect them. And you might want to store this plan so that you don't need to recompute it later. Also, store the total duration as the weight for the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "`networkx` already has a [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) implementation. You will realize that the actual graph search is super fast compared to the other operations, so it's not worth to implement [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) (though it is a nice exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try the dynamic case\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic case is conceptually the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use spatio-temporal nodes. Each node has coordinates `(x,y,theta,t)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can only connect two nodes `(...,t1)` and `(...,t2)` if `t2 > t1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection function to write now should have the form\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def connect_temporal_poses(ps: PlanningSetup, a: FriendlyPose, b: FriendlyPose, dt: float) -> List[PlanStep]:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "because you don't want the fastest plan, but rather the plan that takes exactly `dt = t2 - t1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally, the bounded curvature case\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try to adapt your grid search approach to this case.\n"
