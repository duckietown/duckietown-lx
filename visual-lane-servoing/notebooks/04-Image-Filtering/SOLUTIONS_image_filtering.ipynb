    "In this exercise, we have explored a few filters that can be used to enhance an image, whether by removing noise or other unwanted detail or by emphasizing the presence of specific content, such as edges. These and other filters are an integral step to extracting information from images, whether it is to identify the location of the lane markings and, in turn, the geometry of the robot's lane, or detecting the location of pedestrians (i.e., duckies). These are just a few examples of filters that are commonly used for image processing. Operating on the same principle as filters designed for edge detection, corner detection filters look for locations in the image where there are rapid changes in intensity in both the $x$- and $y$-directions (e.g., like you might see at corners where two lines intersect). These and related filters are often employed to detect \"interest points\", salient points in the image that are used to identify correspondences between multiple images of the same scene (i.e., pixels that correspond to the same object in the world).\n",
