    "### Lens Distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "A pinhole camera is an idealized camera model. As discussed in lecture, we made the aperture sufficiently small that light reflecting off different locations in the scene impact different points on the image (sensor) plane. Here, the goal was to minimize the size of the \"circle of confusion\", regions of the image that record intensity from multiple points in the scene. However, by making the aperture so small, we are, by design, limiting the amount of light that reaches the sensor. This results in a low signal-to-noise ratio, meaning that it is difficult to tease apart valid signal from noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, cameras mitigate this effect by increasing the aperture to sizes that result in significant confusion (i.e., aliasing) and then placing a lens in front of the aperture to control light on the sensor. In this way, a greater amount of light is exposed to the sensor, while being focused on the corresponding pixels (i.e., reducing aliasing). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, lenses themselves are imperfect and cause some distortion in the image. There are several parametric models that describe the effects of different types of distortion and standard calibration procedures, including the one above, estimate these parameters along with the other intrinsic parameters of the camera.\n",

Unlike intrinsic calibration, however, we don't need to move the camera or target around since four point-pairs are sufficient given the eight degrees-of-freedom associated with the homography."
