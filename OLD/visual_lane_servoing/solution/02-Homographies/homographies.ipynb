    "The pinhole camera model provides a many-to-one mapping between points in the scene and their corresponding projection onto the image plane. With knowledge of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that specify the camera matrix, we can relate points in the image to their corresponding rays in the scene. However, we don't know where along this ray the corresponding scene point lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of resolving some of this ambiguity is to use prior knowledge of the environment geometry as a means of adding further structure to the projetion model. In the case of Duckietown, we will use the fact that the environment is planar. In other settings, including self-driving vehicles, while the world may not be globally planar, we can treat it as locally planar around the robot (e.g., imagine the tangent plane on the curved surface that the robot is driving on). We can then exploit this planarity to constrain the projection model.\n",
