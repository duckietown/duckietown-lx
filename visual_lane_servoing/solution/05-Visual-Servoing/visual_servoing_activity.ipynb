    "Now, we use the image processing tools that we have explored to design a policy for lane-following. Consider the above image taken from the Duckiebot's camera when the Duckiebot was centered in its lane. Our goal is to design a control policy that uses only images streamed from the Duckiebot's camera to keep it in the lane as it drives forward at a fixed velocity. \n",

    "Rather than design a controller that reasons over the raw image, we will process the image to enhance aspects of the image that are helpful for lane-following. In particular, the dashed-yellow and solid-white lane markings provide valuable cues that we can use to guide the robot to stay in its lane. \n",

    "Assume that the Duckiebot starts out in the center of its lane, facing in the direction of travel. Assume also that the Duckiebot is traveling forward at a nominal speed. We can imagine using the location of the dashed-yellow and solid-white lane markings in the image to vary the rotational velocities of the left and right wheels in order to stay in the lane. For example, if the dashed-yellow lane markings appear in the left- and right-halves of the image, we might command a negative rotational velocity (i.e., counter-clockwise) as a correction. \n",

    "Of course, this requires that we can detect the dashed-yellow and solid-white lane markings and estimate their orientations.

Lane markings are brightly colored against a dark background (the road). \n",

    "The above strategy is a reasonable first approach to steering your Duckiebot in order to stay in its lane. Depending on your impelementation and your environment, you may even have found that it does a decent job staying in the lane, even around curves. However, as you have likely seen, there are a number of limitations of the approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our strategy for detecting lane markings and designing weight matrices limits the the road geometries that it the Duckiebot can handle. While it may do a decent job navigating gradual curves, it likely can't handle sharp turns or T-intersections, among others;\n",
    "\n",
    "* The detection algorithm is sensitive to changes in illumination, which can result in failed detections (e.g., valid pixels are being filtered out as a result of color masking), and clutter, which can result in erroneous detections (e.g., your Duciebot may hallucinate lane markings on the wall, on duckies, or elsewhere in the town) that cause the Duckiebot to steer in unpredictable ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, hopefully this introduced you to some of the core concepts of image filtering and how you might use it to control the motion of your Duckiebot. Hopefully, it also provided you with first-hand knowledge of some of the challenges of distilling information from images and using them for control, which should set the stage for upcoming topics in the class."
