    "# 🚙 💻 03 - Wheel encoders tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoders are sensors that convert (analog) angular position, or motion of a shaft, into a digital signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Duckietown we use Hall effect encoders [link to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall-effect_sensor), which extract the _incremental_ change in angular position of the wheels. Every time the shaft rotates of a certain set angle, i.e., the resolution of the encoder, it emits a pulse. We call these pulses \"ticks\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use ticks from both wheels to measure the variation of the position of the Duckiebot while it moves. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity we learn how to access the data coming from the wheel encoders of our Duckiebot (whether physical or simulated), and understand what each field means. We will use this data for later activities."
