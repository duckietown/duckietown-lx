    "A *state* describes the condition of our robot at a specific time. This may include information about where the robot is, or other factors related to the environment that may affect the robot. When we develop a robotics algorithm, we are responsible to decide the information that we wish to include in the state. In other words, the definition of state depends on the task that we are trying to solve. Ideally, we want a state to exhibit the following properties:\n",

    "An example of a state representation that is often used in robotics is the *pose*. A *pose* represents the location of the robot in the world as well as its orientation (i.e., what direction is the robot facing towards). Since we live in a 3-dimensional (3D) world, we represent the location of the robot as its $(x,y,z)$ coordinate in the world. We can represent orientation in terms of its roll, pitch, and yaw angles (also known as Euler angle representation). For example, the yaw angle $\\theta_{yaw}$ will be the angle difference between the longitudinal axis of the robot from the reference frame.\n",
