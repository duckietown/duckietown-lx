    "The controller is where the decision making part of a robot's mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "Controllers output _commands_, which are signals that will be executed by our robot's actuators, with the objective of achieving a certain goal. The inputs to the controller are typically signals that helps define this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of the Duckiebot, the (output) control signals are the linear velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\\omega$ of the robot. In other words, the controller will decide, at every time instant, at what speed should the Duckiebot go and how much should it steer left or right to, for example, stay in the lane. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **P**roportional-**I**ntegral-**D**erivative (PID) controller is an example of a feedback controller where the goal is defined in terms of one or more tracking error signals ($e_t$), which are the input to the controller. The controller will try to bring the error ideally to zero, hence the system output ($y_t$) to match the reference signal ($r_t$). \n",

    "Consider a Duckiebot driving in the middle of a road with a constant linear velocity ($v_0$). In the lane following task our goal is to make sure the robot stays in the middle of the lane by adjusting its angular velocity. Intuitively, whenever the robot deviates from the middle of the lane, we will adjust the angular velocity so the robot turns toward the middle of the lane. The question is: by how much?\n",
    "\n",
    "The name proportional-integral-derivative comes from the fact that the controller adjusts the control signals proportionally to the error at every time instant, while also considers the integral (i.e., the sum, or accumulation) of the error over time, and the derivative of the error at each time step (i.e., the rate of change of the error over time). \n",
    "\n",
    "The control command is calculated by considering the combination of these three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_t = k_p e(t) + k_i \\int_0^t e(\\tau) d \\tau + k_d \\frac{d e_t}{dt},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_p$, $k_i$, and $k_d$ are the proportional, integral, and derivative coefficients of the controller, respectively, and weigh the three terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PID control problem is to determine values for these parameters (e.g., via trial and error) until the closed loop system performs reasonably well. Typically (but it depends strongly on the complexity of the system):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increasing $k_p$ will decrease the the time it takes for the system to approach the reference point (i.e., rise time), but at the risk of overshooting the reference. A high $k_p$ leads to an aggressive control. \n",
    "- Increasing $k_d$ will help to decrease this overshooting by preventing the robot from moving too quickly in a direction that increases the error. \n",
    "- Increasing $k_i$ will help eliminate the steady-state error (i.e., the remaining error once the system has converged), and compensate for unexpected external disturbances during operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can start by only adjusting $k_p$ while keeping $k_i=0$ and $k_d=0$ until the controller is somewhat able to reach the target. We can then fix $k_p$ at this value, and start adjusting $k_d$. Once we found a good value of $k_d$, that reduces the oscillations without slowing the system response down too much, we can proceed to adjust $k_i$ as needed to mitigate steady state errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above approach to tune our PID controller may work in practice, there is **no guarantee** that our robot will be stable (e.g., it may oscillate around or even completely diverge from the reference point). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches for designing PID controllers in a formal way and obtaining those guarantees. Talking about them though would require introducing more advanced system modeling methods (e.g., linearization, linear time-invariant systems, state-space representations, transfer functions), as well as analysis methods for dynamic systems (e.g., Bode diagrams, Nyquist plots, root locus) and synthesis techniques (e.g., loop shaping, pole placement), for actually determining the coefficients. There is a vast literature on PID control, and new variations on the theme are published every year although it is already a very established method. A video introduction to control systems can be found online, e.g., in the [Control Systems I](https://video.ethz.ch/lectures/d-mavt/2018/autumn/151-0591-00L/6a74fd84-5047-4639-b640-3ab2e6937e8a.html) course held at ETH Zurich.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of PID control is due to the fact, amongst other factors, that these formal methods are not necessary to reach a satisfactory outcome. \"Rule of thumb\" methods such as the Ziegler-Nichols can help us to tune our PID controller, but trail and error (or, \"synthesis by iterations\", a. k. a. \"tweak until death\") works, too!\n",

    "- Input saturations: real robots have saturations (e.g. `omega_max` in the kinematics parameters, which has been set in previous activities). This means that occasionally having the controller act more aggressively will not change the system's response, as there are other real world constraints. Saturations might represent physical limitations of hardware (intuitively, the higher the value of the input, the higher \"energy\" it will take to actuate that command. Energy is not free, nor infinitely available.), or overarching safety constraints that have been put in place to prevent dangerous things from happening. When inputs saturate, errors (especially the integral one) might continue building up, causing a situation that will break the logic of the PID controller. For this reason, typically `anti wind-up` mechanisms are implemented to prevent either input saturation, of the integral error building up too much. There are many fancy `anti wind-up` strategies; we implemented a simple one in the controller above. \n",

    "- The robot doesn't have the slightest idea of what is going on around it. This is beacause we are using interoceptive sensors (wheel encoders) to create the robot's belief. The **real** state of the robot is unknown to it. Moreover, lack of exteroceptive sensors (e.g., a camera) makes the robot unable to \"anchor\" its belief to some real-world feature, and perform sanity checks. You might have noticed that a Duckiebot will _not_ take that turn in your Duckietown autonomously, and that's because it has no notion of a map. For this very reason we will introduce cameras and computer vision in the future modules. "
