    "# Altitude Tuning on the Duckiedrone \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you will be transferring the altitude PID you created in the previous notebook onto your drone. You will then tune the PID gains on your drone as you did in the simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flying with Our PID\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will use the camera to estimate velocity with Optical Flow, and the range\n",
    "sensor to estimate height.  Then the PID controller will set the PWMs\n",
    "to achieve these targets: either a fixed velocity of $0 m/s$ in $X$ and $Y$,\n",
    "or a fixed velocity based on what keys are pressed on the keyboard.\n",
    "We are doing position control for the height, so it adjusts the\n",
    "throttle to maintain a target height above the ground using an\n",

    "### Test Flying!\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions in the operations manual in order to fly \n",

    "\n",
    "Make sure this works before trying to tune your own PID.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using your own PID\n",
    "You will now be using your altitude PID to control the height of the drone. To tune your altitude PID, you will first use the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method to generate an initial set of tuning parameters. You will then fine tune these parameters similar to how you tuned the drone in simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use your PID, you'll be running the Python script `student_pid_controller.py` instead of the default `pid_controller.py`. This will allow your height PID to run alongside our planar PIDs: your PID will be responsible for keeping the drone flying steady vertically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup**  \n",
    "1. Change directories to `~/catkin_ws/src`. Run `git clone https://github.com/h2r/project-pid-implementation-<yourGithubName>.git`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Move inside your PID project folder (`~/catkin_ws/src/project-pid-implementation-<yourGitHubName>/`) and modify the PID values in `z_pid.yaml` by setting $K$ to 1250 and the rest of the gains to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change directories into `~/catkin_ws/src/pidrone_pkg` and modify `pi.screenrc` to start up with your altitude PID by changing:\n",
    "    * line 50: change `stuff \"cd $(rospack find pidrone_pkg)/scripts/\\n\"` to `stuff \"cd ~/catkin_ws/src/project-pid-implementation-<yourGitHubName>\\n\"`, making sure to **replace** <yourGitHubName> with your GitHub username (you can comment the existing line by prefixing `#` to it, if you want to revert to the default PID).\n",
    "    * line 51: change `python pid_controller.py\\n` to `python  student_pid_controller.py\\n`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. Prepare your drone to fly and start the `screen` session by running `screen -c pi.screenrc`. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once inside the `screen` session then navigate to the screen \\`2. Make sure that it is publishing values correctly.\n",

    "Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>c</kbd> to quit `student_pid_controller`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Exercises**  \n",
    "Now you will fly your drone, observe its flight behavior and tune the gains to improve it. You will tune the gains according to the Ziegler-Nicholson method, of which you had an overview in the [first notebook](./1-general_overview.ipynb). Review it before continuing with this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Tune $K_p$ by _slowly_ increasing its value between flights until you can see the drone moving up and down with uniform oscillations. Each time you will need to quit the controller, edit `~/catkin_ws/src/project-pid-implementation-<yourGitHubName>/z_pid.yaml`, and then run `python student_pid_controller.py` again in the screen \\`2 to use the new PID gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Record the $K_p$ value that causes _uniform oscillations_ as $K_u$, the _ultimate gain_.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Fly your drone and pause the altitude graph on the web interface when you see two peaks. Find the time difference between these two peaks and record this value as $T_u$, the ultimate period.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Use your $K_u$ and $T_u$ values to compute $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$ by referring to the equations in the Ziegler-Nichols section in the [first notebook](./1-general_overview.ipynb) in the introduction to this project. Record these values and change `z_pid.yaml` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Fly your drone with the set of tuning values generated by the Ziegler-Nichols method. Note that the Ziegler-Nichols method should enable safe flight, but will probably not control your drone's altitude very well! Empirically tune the gain constants in `z_pid.yaml` on your drone as you did in the simulator portion of this project. <sup id=\"a6\">[2](#f6)</sup> Record your final tuning values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Footnotes\n",
    "[<b id=\"f6\">2</b>](#a6) Use the graph on the web interface to observe the drone's behavior as it oscillates around the 0.3m setpoint the drone's ability to hover at the setpoint. When observing the drone itself, try to get eye-level with the drone to just focus on the the altitude and ignore the planar motion; it is easier to focus on one axis at a time when tuning the PIDs. The planar axes can be re-tuned after you tune your altitude pid if need be.\n"
