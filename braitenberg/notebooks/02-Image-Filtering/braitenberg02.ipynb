Use [this online color picker](https://pinetools.com/image-color-picker) to click around on the sample images in the `/assets/samples` directory and get familiar with what color corresponds to which HSV values. (You can use any other tool, the link is just for reference.)  This will set you up to narrow in on the duckie yellow more quickly.\n",

    "    To get this interactive method running, open a terminal on your computer, **navigate to the exercise folder** (`duckietown-lx/braitenberg/`) and type:\n",

    "    `dts code build`\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    Following the link will bring up the VNC desktop, where you can click on the HSV activity icon and run the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After you have a satisfactory result in the VNC tool, open the file [preprocessing.py](../../packages/solution/preprocessing.py), and change the values of `lower_hsv` and `upper_hsv` to the ones that you found to highlight the duckie.  This will be used by your Braitenberg agent in the next notebook."
